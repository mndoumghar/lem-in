`oerraoui`       Add BFS algorithm, update simulation code, and unify struct usage

- Implemented a BFS shortest-path algorithm in internal/algo/bfs.go, using the Room and Graph structure.
- Updated simulation logic in internal/output/output.go to use the correct fields and struct names (Graph, Room, Isend).
- Ensured all references match the projectâ€™s data types, including proper ant assignment and movement.
- Added/clarified the Path struct for output simulation if not already present.
- Added AntCount field to Graph for ant distribution logic.
- Provided clear struct definitions in internal/parsfile/struct.go for Room, Graph, and Ant.
